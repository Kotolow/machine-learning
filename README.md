# machine-learning

Here's my own implementation of the following machine learning algorithms:  
  - Charm algorithm
  - GSP
  - Kmeans
  - DBSCAN
Python is used as the programming language.

# Charm
Appointment: Search for closed frequently occurring itemsets.


# GSP
Appointment: Finding Frequent Sequences.

# Kmeans
Appointment: Clustering Algorithm.  

# DBSCAN
Appointment: Clustering Algorithm.
